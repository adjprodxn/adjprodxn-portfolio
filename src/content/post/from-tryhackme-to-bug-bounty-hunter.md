## The Early Days on TryHackMe

My journey into the world of cybersecurity began on TryHackMe, a platform that provided me with the foundational knowledge and hands-on experience I needed. I started with the basics, learning about web application vulnerabilities, network security, and penetration testing methodologies. The interactive labs and real-world scenarios were invaluable in building my confidence and skills.

## Making the Leap to Bug Bounties

After months of dedicated learning and practice on TryHackMe, I felt ready to test my skills in a real-world environment. I decided to take the plunge into the world of bug bounty hunting. It was a daunting step, but the thrill of finding and reporting my first vulnerability was an incredible motivator. I started with smaller programs and gradually moved on to more complex targets as my experience grew.

## My Daily Routine as a Bug Bounty Hunter

A typical day for me as a bug bounty hunter is a mix of research, reconnaissance, and active testing. I dedicate a significant portion of my time to staying updated on the latest vulnerabilities and attack techniques. My routine generally consists of:

- **Morning:** Reconnaissance and target selection. I use various tools to gather information about my target and identify potential attack vectors.
- **Afternoon:** Active testing and vulnerability scanning. This is where I apply the knowledge and skills I've gained to find security flaws.
- **Evening:** Reporting and documentation. Clearly documenting my findings is crucial for a successful submission.

## Tips for Aspiring Hunters

For those looking to follow a similar path, here are a few tips that I've found helpful:

1.  **Build a Strong Foundation:** Platforms like TryHackMe are excellent for learning the fundamentals.
2.  **Stay Curious and Persistent:** The world of cybersecurity is constantly evolving. Continuous learning is key.
3.  **Start Small:** Begin with smaller, less competitive bug bounty programs to build your confidence and reputation.
4.  **Learn to Write Good Reports:** A well-written report that clearly explains the vulnerability and its impact is more likely to be accepted and rewarded.
5.  **Join the Community:** Engage with other security researchers on platforms like Twitter and Discord. The community is a great resource for learning and collaboration.
